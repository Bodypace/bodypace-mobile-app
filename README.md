# Bodypace -- Mobile app

General information about this app is on https://bodypace.org.<br/>We try not to describe here what is already explained there.

Here we mention stuff that is important for devs who want to work on this app.

This app is built with plain [Expo](https://expo.dev/) without any trickery or advanced adaptations.
